# Netflix-capstone-project
One of my favorite projects is Netflix Data Analysis, where I explored 8,800+ titles from the Netflix catalog. I cleaned missing data, standardized formats, and analyzed patterns across genres, countries, release years, ratings, and durations. Key findings include:  Average movie length is ~100 minutes.  Dramas and Comedies dominate the catalog.
